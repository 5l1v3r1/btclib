# Warning

Most of the python scripts included in this folder depend on the btclib
library: to execute them, btclib must have been installed.

Alternatively, move these python scripts up one level in the folder structure, putting them at the same level of the `btclib`: in this way they can see (the folder) btclib without installing the library
