## Bitcoin & Blockchain Technology

Python library (and assorted material) originated from the Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology course of Milano Bicocca and Politecnico di Milano Universities. Most of the material is instrumental for teaching and homeworks.

The `btclib` folder contains Python code, namely Python3 with type annotation. It is not intended to be used in production environments, as it will probably have major refactorings with no care at all for backward compatibility.
