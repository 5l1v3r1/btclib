btclib is intended for teaching and demonstration of the cryptography used in bitcoin; algorithms are not to be used in production environments: they could be broken using side-channel attacks. Moreover, they will probably have major refactorings without care for backward compatibility.

To install (and upgrade) `btclib`:
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade btclib
```
